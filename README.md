# AccommoEdu
MVC Web Application for managing student accommodations for educational institutions

# A brief description of the purpose of your software:
The software name has "Accommo" (short for "Accommodation) which indicates that the software is linked to housing or accommodations and "Edu" (short for "Education") which denotes that the software is closely related to the field of education.
By combining "Accommo" and "Edu," the name effectively communicates that the software is focused on addressing the accommodation requirements of students and educational organizations. It is a complete software solution developed to simplify and streamline the management of student accommodations within the educational sector. Its principal goal is to assist educational institutions, such as schools and universities, in handling all elements of student housing and lodging in an efficient manner, ensuring that students have comfortable and acceptable lodgings during their academic journeys.

# Functionalities that users will be allowed to perform, and/or the features of the software:

**Accommodation Management:** Educational institutions can use AccommoEdu to manage various types of student accommodations, including dormitories, apartments, and shared housing. They can allocate rooms, set occupancy limits, and handle room assignment processes.

**Application Portal:** AccommoEdu offers a user-friendly portal for students to apply for accommodations. They can specify their preferences, roommate choices, and any special requirements, such as accessibility needs.

**Billing and Payments:** AccommoEdu facilitates the management of rent payments and other housing-related fees, allowing students to make secure online payments.

**Feedback and Surveys:** Allow students to provide feedback on their accommodations, helping the institution make improvements based on their experiences.

# Logical Viewpoint:

-The workflow starts with the "Search for Accommodation" action, which leads to displaying accommodation options.

-Subsequently, the user selects a preferred accommodation, progresses to book it, and confirms the associated booking details.

This system is a linear sequence which is depicted in the Diagram using rounded rectangles to represent actions or activities, arrows to illustrate the flow of activities. The diagram is visually anchored by a black circle denoting the start of the workflow and concludes with an encircled black circle, symbolizing the final state.
